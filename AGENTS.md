# AGENTS.md — core-panel-frontend

The base panel host. Read `panel-contract`'s AGENTS.md first — this repo consumes
that contract.

## What's base vs. extension

**Base (here):** shell/chrome, the pre-paint auth gate (`/me`-confirmed presence
hint — port from `tds-admin`'s `Layout.astro`, DON'T reinvent), nav renderer,
**Dashboard widget host** + per-user layout, Wiki, user management, the settings
framework (the wizard/list shell; individual sections come from extensions),
i18n plumbing, the API fetch wrapper (401→`/me` backstop, cross-panel SSO).

**Extensions (other repos):** time-tracker, blog-CMS, website-CMS, contact- and
support-tickets, … They contribute pages/widgets/nav/settings/permissions/i18n
through `panel-contract` — never edited here.

## Composition (build-time only)

`panelHost({ extensions: [...] })` in `astro.config.mjs`. No runtime plugin
loading, never `output: "server"`. The shell reads `virtual:panel-registry`
(nav/permissions/i18n), `virtual:panel-widgets` and `virtual:panel-settings`
(components with real imports). Declared in `src/env.d.ts`.

## Two product targets

Admin and customer are the same host with different extension lists. Keep target
differences to the `astro.config` / build env, not forks of the shell.

## Gotchas (carried from the platform)

- Astro can't hydrate a component named only by a string — the widget/settings
  virtual modules carry real imports; render `const W = item.Component; <W />`.
- Keep the frontend **static**; the auth gate is inline `<head>` + `/me` probe.
- Don't hand-author the lightningcss `cssTarget`; spread tds-shared's
  `tdsViteBuild` once the design system is wired.
- `npm install --no-package-lock` (Windows lockfile is win32-only).

## Per-user dashboard layout

The Dashboard (`src/pages/index.astro`) renders EVERY enabled widget into
`.widget-slot[data-widget]` sections at **build time** (server-side; islands
hydrate as usual). `src/lib/dashboardLayout.ts` then, on load, fetches the user's
saved layout from core-panel-api (`GET /me/dashboard-layout`) and **reorders +
shows/hides the existing DOM slots** to match — no SSR, no runtime widget
fetching. An "Anpassen" edit mode adds drag-to-reorder (HTML5 DnD from the handle)
+ per-widget visibility checkboxes and persists via `PUT /me/dashboard-layout`.
Progressive enhancement: no saved layout or an unreachable API ⇒ every widget
stays visible in authored order. The edit-mode CSS is an inline `<style>` in the
page (raw, per [[project_astro_inline_script_raw]]); the script is a real module
import (`<script>import { initDashboardLayout }…`), not inline, so no brace trap.

## User management (Nutzerverwaltung)

`UsersAdmin.tsx` is the full editor: list/create/reset-password/delete plus a
per-user form for the admin / support-agent / blog-author flags, account status,
and **company memberships with per-company portal permissions** (the fine-grained
RBAC). Users come from tds-auth-api (`/admin/users`; `PATCH` already accepts
`memberships`, `isSupportAgent`, `isBlogAuthor`, `status`), companies from
tds-customer-api (`GET /customer/admin/customers` via the gateway prefix,
`CUSTOMER_API_URL`). Portal permission keys/labels/presets come from
`tds-shared/permissions` (`PORTAL_PERMISSIONS`) — never inline them. Admins bypass
portal permissions, so their memberships are cleared on save. The company list is
best-effort: unreachable ⇒ ids shown instead of names, editing still works. (No
auth-API change was needed — the endpoints already existed. Avatar/bio/author-
snapshot from the old tds-admin editor are intentionally omitted — they pull in
content-api; add them only if the blog byline needs them here.)

## Status / next

Composition proven end-to-end (routes + nav + hydrated widgets + settings), auth
gate + chrome + tds-shared wired, Wiki / users (incl. fine-grained permission +
membership editing) / settings pages built, per-user dashboard layout done, both
product targets (admin/customer) build + deploy. Next: move the dashboard-layout
DDL into a base migration once core-panel-api gains a migrator; optionally port the
author-profile (avatar/bio) editor if the blog byline is managed from here.
